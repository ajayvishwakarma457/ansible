    3. Tasks â€“ Individual actions that use modules (written inside playbooks).
    4. Playbooks â€“ YAML files that define automation workflows (tasks + hosts + variables).
    5. Handlers â€“ Special tasks that run only when triggered (e.g., restart service after config change).
    6. Variables â€“ Store reusable values (package names, versions, file paths).
    7.Templates (Jinja2) â€“ Dynamic config files using variables and logic.
    8. Roles â€“ Standard way to organize playbooks into reusable structures.
    9 .Ansible Galaxy â€“ Public repository for community roles and collections.
    10. Ansible Vault â€“ Encrypts sensitive data like passwords and API keys.
    11. Plugins â€“ Extend Ansible features (connection, lookup, filter, callback).
    12. Collections â€“ Distributable bundles of roles, modules, and plugins (e.g., AWS, Kubernetes).
