ðŸš€ AWS + EC2 Learning Roadmap (Basic â†’ Expert)

    1. EC2 Basics (Beginner)
        1. What is EC2, instance types, pricing models (On-demand, Reserved, Spot).
        2. Launching EC2 instance (which youâ€™ve done âœ…).
        3. Connect via SSH using .pem key.
        4. Installing software (Node.js, Nginx, Docker, etc.).
        5. Security Groups (allowing inbound ports 22/80/443).
        6. Elastic IP (attach static IP to instance).
        ðŸ‘‰ Practice: Deploy a simple Node.js / Next.js app on EC2 manually.


    2. Intermediate Level (Industry Use-Cases)
        1. EBS Volumes: Attach, detach, resize storage.
        2. AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Create your own reusable server images.
        3. Load Balancer (ALB/NLB): Distribute traffic across instances.
        4. Auto Scaling Groups: Handle traffic spikes.
        5. IAM Roles for EC2 (accessing S3, DynamoDB, etc. without storing credentials).
        6. CloudWatch Monitoring & Alarms for CPU, Memory, Disk.
        ðŸ‘‰ Practice: Deploy your app on 2 EC2 instances + Load Balancer + Auto Scaling.


    3. Advanced Level (MNC-Style Setup)
        1. Networking: VPC, subnets (public/private), NAT Gateway, route tables.
        2. Private EC2 + Bastion Host for security.
        3. Elastic File System (EFS): Shared storage across multiple EC2s.
        4. System Manager (SSM): Access EC2 without SSH keys.
        5. Blue/Green Deployment with EC2 + Load Balancer.
        6. CloudFormation / Terraform for EC2 automation (infra-as-code).
        7. Ansible for configuration management.
        8. CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions â†’ EC2 deploy via CodeDeploy).
        ðŸ‘‰ Practice: Automate full VPC + EC2 + ALB + ASG + CloudWatch setup using Terraform & Ansible.


    4. Expert Level (MNC Production Practices)
        1. Zero Downtime Deployments (Rolling, Blue/Green, Canary).
        2. Security Hardening:
            1. Restricting inbound rules, using SSM instead of SSH.
            2. Patching EC2 with SSM Patch Manager.
            3. Secrets via AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store / Secrets Manager.
        3. High Availability & DR:
            1. Multi-AZ deployment.
            2. Backups & Snapshots automation.
        4. Cost Optimization:
            1. Reserved/Spot Instances.
            2. Rightsizing EC2.
        5. Observability:
            1. CloudWatch Logs, Metrics.
            2. Centralized logging with ELK/CloudWatch Logs Insights.
        6. Migration to Serverless / Containers:
            1. Running workloads on ECS, EKS, or App Runner.
            2. Using EC2 only when required.
        ðŸ‘‰ Practice: Replicate MNC architecture (multi-AZ, automated, secure, cost-optimized).
