üõ†Ô∏è Ansible Learning Roadmap (Beginner ‚Üí Expert)

üîπ Beginner (Foundations)

  1. What is Ansible?
    Basics of automation, IaC, agentless architecture.
    Push vs Pull model.

  2. Installation & Setup
    Install Ansible on Linux/Mac/WSL.
    Understand inventory (hosts.ini) and ansible.cfg.
    Run ad-hoc commands (ansible all -m ping).

  3. YAML Basics
    Learn YAML syntax (indentation, lists, dictionaries).

  4. Playbooks
    Write simple playbooks (install packages, copy files, start services).
    Idempotency concept.

üîπ Intermediate (Practical Usage)

  5. Modules
    Common modules: apt, yum, service, copy, template, user, file.
    Cloud modules: AWS EC2, S3, RDS, IAM.

  6. Variables & Facts
    Define variables in playbooks, group_vars, host_vars.
    Use ansible_facts (OS, IP, memory).

  7. Handlers & Notifications
    Restart services only when config changes.

  8. Templates (Jinja2)
    Create dynamic config files (nginx.conf, app.env).

  9. Loops & Conditionals
    Loop through users, packages, or files.
    Run tasks only on certain OS / environments.

  10. Error Handling
    ignore_errors, when, failed_when.


üîπ Advanced (Industry Approach)

  11. Roles & Best Practices
    Structure playbooks into roles (tasks/, handlers/, vars/, templates/).
    Use Galaxy roles (ansible-galaxy init role_name).

  12. Ansible Vault
    Encrypt secrets (DB passwords, API keys).
    Use with CI/CD pipelines.

  13. Dynamic Inventory
    AWS EC2 plugin (fetch servers by tags).
    Azure/GCP/VMware inventory plugins.

  14. Ansible Tower / AWX
    Web UI & RBAC for Ansible in enterprises.
    Job templates, scheduling, approvals.

  15. CI/CD Integration
    Run Ansible playbooks inside Jenkins/GitHub Actions pipelines.
    GitOps approach.

  16. Ansible + Terraform
    Terraform ‚Üí Provision infrastructure.
    Ansible ‚Üí Configure + deploy apps.

  17. Ansible + Kubernetes
    Deploy Docker images to EKS/ECS/K8s.
    Configure monitoring/logging.

  18. Performance & Scaling
    Parallelism (forks, serial).
    Delegation, async tasks.

üîπ Expert (Enterprise Grade)

  19. Testing
    Use ansible-lint, molecule for testing roles.
    CI pipelines with playbook validation.

  20. Compliance & Security
    Security hardening playbooks (CIS benchmark).
    Automate OS patching across 1000+ servers.

  21. Advanced Orchestration
    Multi-tier app deployment (web + app + DB).
    Blue-green & rolling deployments.

  22. Contribute & Optimize
    Contribute to Ansible Galaxy roles.
    Write custom modules & plugins (Python).

‚úÖ Summary Path:

From Claude 

1 .Core Architecture

  Agentless design - No need to install software on managed nodes, uses SSH/WinRM
  Push-based model - Control node pushes configurations to managed nodes
  Idempotent operations - Running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result

2. Essential Components
  Inventory - Defines which hosts/groups Ansible manages (static files or dynamic sources)
  Playbooks - YAML files containing ordered lists of tasks to execute
  Tasks - Individual units of work that call modules
  Modules - Reusable code units that perform specific actions (copy files, install packages, etc.)
  Roles - Organized way to group related tasks, variables, and files for reusability

3. Key Concepts
  Variables and templating - Using Jinja2 templates for dynamic configuration
  Conditionals and loops - Control task execution with when statements and iteration
  Handlers - Tasks triggered by changes in other tasks (like restarting services)
  Vault - Encrypted storage for sensitive data like passwords and keys

4. Advanced Features
  Galaxy - Community hub for sharing and downloading roles
  Dynamic inventory - Automatically discover hosts from cloud providers or CMDBs
  Tower/AWX - Web-based UI and API for enterprise automation
  Collections - Packaged distributions of playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins
